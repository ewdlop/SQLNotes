If you're referring to why people might ask internally within an organization about why SQL Server doesn't have built-in SQL injection prevention mechanisms, it may come from a misunderstanding of the database's role and the development practices required to ensure security. While SQL Server does provide tools and best practices to prevent SQL injection, it relies on developers to implement these measures correctly.

Here are some common internal questions and appropriate responses:

1. **Why doesn't SQL Server automatically prevent SQL injection?**
   - SQL Server provides features such as parameterized queries and stored procedures that, when used correctly, can prevent SQL injection. However, it requires developers to follow best practices to ensure these mechanisms are used effectively.

2. **What features does SQL Server offer to help prevent SQL injection?**
   - SQL Server offers parameterized queries, stored procedures, and roles and permissions to restrict access. Additionally, using ORM frameworks and validating user inputs can significantly reduce the risk of SQL injection.

3. **How can we ensure our applications are secure against SQL injection?**
   - Ensure that all SQL queries use parameterized queries or stored procedures, validate and sanitize user inputs, follow the principle of least privilege for database access, and regularly review and update your security practices.

4. **Can we configure SQL Server to reject potentially dangerous queries?**
   - While SQL Server itself does not automatically reject dangerous queries, developers can implement input validation and use application-level firewalls or database firewalls to monitor and block malicious queries.

By understanding and utilizing the tools and practices provided by SQL Server, developers can build secure applications that are resistant to SQL injection attacks.

i meant they have time to add all the ai feature, geo feature, json featues all that database features steal from other tech

```csharp
using System;
using System.Data.SqlClient;

string connectionString = "your-database-connection-string";
SqlInjectionPrevention prevention = new SqlInjectionPrevention(connectionString);
prevention.GetUserDetails("testuser");

public class SqlInjectionPrevention
{
    private string connectionString;

    public SqlInjectionPrevention(string connectionString)
    {
        this.connectionString = connectionString;
    }

    public void GetUserDetails(string username)
    {
        string query = "SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Username = @Username";

        using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
        {
            SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(query, connection);
            // Use parameterized query to prevent SQL injection
            command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@Username", username);

            connection.Open();
            SqlDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader();

            while (reader.Read())
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Username: {reader["Username"]}, Email: {reader["Email"]}");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Composite Keys in SQL

Composite keys (also known as compound keys) are primary keys composed of two or more columns that together uniquely identify each row in a table. This repository includes a comprehensive example demonstrating composite key concepts.

### Id-Ego-Superego Composite Key Example

The `T-Sql/id-ego-superego-composite-key.tsql` file provides a creative demonstration of composite keys using Freudian psychology concepts. In this example:

- **id**: Represents the instinctive, primitive desires (integer value)
- **ego**: Represents the realistic, mediating part (integer value)
- **superego**: Represents the moral, idealistic part (integer value)

Together, these three columns form a composite primary key that uniquely identifies different psychological states. The example includes:

1. **Main Table**: `PsychologicalState` with composite key (id, ego, superego)
2. **Related Tables**: `PsychologicalConflict`, `BehavioralOutcome`, `PsycheMetrics`
3. **Complex Queries**: Demonstrating joins, CTEs, and analysis using composite keys
4. **Referential Integrity**: Shows how foreign keys reference composite keys

```sql
CREATE TABLE PsychologicalState (
    id INT NOT NULL,
    ego INT NOT NULL,
    superego INT NOT NULL,
    stateName VARCHAR(100),
    description VARCHAR(500),
    conflictLevel DECIMAL(3,2),
    CONSTRAINT PK_PsychologicalState PRIMARY KEY (id, ego, superego)
);
```

### Key Benefits Demonstrated

- **Natural Representation**: Models complex multi-dimensional concepts
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures uniqueness across multiple attributes
- **Referential Integrity**: Maintains consistency across related tables
- **Real-World Modeling**: Reflects actual relationships in the domain

For a complete guide on composite keys, including when to use them, best practices, advantages, and disadvantages, see the [CompositeKeys.md](CompositeKeys.md) documentation.

## Using TSqlParser for Parsing and Analyzing SQL Scripts

The `T-Sql/TSqlParser.md` file provides a detailed explanation of the `TSqlParser` class and its usage. The `TSqlParser` class from the Microsoft.Data.Tools.Schema.Sql library is used to parse T-SQL scripts. This can be useful for analyzing SQL scripts, including detecting potential SQL injection vulnerabilities by examining the structure and content of the queries.

For more details and examples, refer to the `T-Sql/TSqlParser.md` file.

# Algorithms for Recovery and Isolation Exploiting Semantics**,

ARIES, which stands for **Algorithms for Recovery and Isolation Exploiting Semantics**, is a robust and widely adopted recovery method used in database management systems (DBMS). Developed by IBM researchers C. Mohan, Don Haderle, Bruce Lindsay, Hamid Pirahesh, and Peter Schwarz in the early 1990s, ARIES is renowned for its efficiency in ensuring data integrity and consistency, especially in the face of system failures.

### Key Objectives of ARIES

1. **Atomicity**: Ensures that transactions are all-or-nothing; either all operations of a transaction are completed, or none are.
2. **Durability**: Guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, its changes persist even in the event of a system crash.
3. **Isolation**: Maintains transaction independence, preventing concurrent transactions from interfering with each other in a way that leads to inconsistency.

### Core Components and Concepts

1. **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)**:
   - **Principle**: Before any changes are made to the database, the corresponding log records are written to stable storage (like disk).
   - **Purpose**: Ensures that in the event of a crash, the system can recover by replaying the logged operations.

2. **Log Records**:
   - **Types**:
     - **Update Records**: Capture modifications to data items.
     - **Commit/Abort Records**: Indicate the completion or termination of transactions.
     - **Checkpoint Records**: Provide a snapshot of the systemâ€™s state at a particular point in time.
   - **Components**: Typically include a Log Sequence Number (LSN), transaction ID, operation details, and pointers to previous log records.

3. **Checkpoints**:
   - **Function**: Reduce the amount of work needed during recovery by capturing a consistent state of the database at specific intervals.
   - **Content**: Includes information about active transactions, dirty pages (pages modified in memory but not yet written to disk), and their LSNs.

4. **Recovery Phases**:
   ARIES employs a **three-phase recovery process** upon system restart after a failure:

   - **Analysis Phase**:
     - **Objective**: Reconstruct the state of the system at the time of failure.
     - **Tasks**:
       - Identify active transactions at the checkpoint.
       - Determine dirty pages that need to be redone.
       - Update transaction tables with the latest information.

   - **Redo Phase**:
     - **Objective**: Reapply all changes from the log to ensure that all committed transactionsâ€™ effects are reflected in the database.
     - **Process**:
       - Scan the log from the earliest required LSN.
       - Re-execute all operations, regardless of whether they were previously applied, to handle cases where some changes might not have been flushed to disk.

   - **Undo Phase**:
     - **Objective**: Reverse the effects of transactions that were active but not committed at the time of the crash.
     - **Process**:
       - Traverse the log backward.
       - Undo operations of incomplete transactions to maintain atomicity.

5. **Concurrency Control and Isolation**:
   - ARIES integrates with locking mechanisms to manage concurrent access to data.
   - Ensures that transactions are isolated from one another, preventing phenomena like dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.

### Advantages of ARIES

- **Fine-Grained Recovery**: Can recover from partial failures and allows for selective page recovery.
- **Support for Nested Transactions**: Handles complex transaction structures efficiently.
- **Incremental Checkpoints**: Minimizes the overhead of checkpointing by only logging necessary information.
- **Efficient Log Management**: Uses techniques like log sequence numbers to manage and access log records effectively.

### Implementation and Usage

ARIES has been implemented in several prominent DBMS products, including IBM's DB2 and Microsoft's SQL Server. Its design principles have influenced many modern recovery algorithms, underscoring its significance in the field of database systems.

### Conclusion

ARIES is a cornerstone in the realm of database recovery and transaction management. Its comprehensive approach to handling system failures, ensuring data integrity, and managing concurrent transactions makes it a preferred choice for high-reliability database systems. Understanding ARIES is fundamental for professionals involved in database design, implementation, and maintenance.

Certainly! Let's delve into both topics you've mentioned:

1. **One-Phase Commit vs. Two-Phase Commit**
2. **Types of Locks in Transaction Processing**

---

## 1. One-Phase Commit vs. Two-Phase Commit

In distributed database systems, ensuring that transactions are processed reliably across multiple resources (like databases, services, or servers) is crucial. Commit protocols are mechanisms that ensure all participating resources in a transaction either **commit** (apply) or **abort** (rollback) the transaction to maintain data consistency. The two primary commit protocols are **One-Phase Commit (1PC)** and **Two-Phase Commit (2PC)**.

### **One-Phase Commit (1PC)**

**Overview:**
- **Definition:** A straightforward commit protocol typically used in systems where transactions involve only a single resource or database.
- **Process:** The coordinator sends a commit command directly to the single participant, which then commits the transaction.

**Workflow:**
1. **Transaction Execution:** The transaction is executed on the single resource.
2. **Commit Decision:** The resource decides to commit the transaction.
3. **Commit Execution:** The resource commits the transaction and informs the coordinator.

**Advantages:**
- **Simplicity:** Easy to implement due to its straightforward nature.
- **Efficiency:** Lower overhead since there's only one resource involved.

**Disadvantages:**
- **Limited Scope:** Not suitable for distributed transactions involving multiple resources.
- **Lack of Atomicity Across Multiple Resources:** Cannot ensure that multiple resources either all commit or all abort, leading to potential inconsistencies.

**Use Cases:**
- Single-database transactions where only one resource is involved.
  
### **Two-Phase Commit (2PC)**

**Overview:**
- **Definition:** A commit protocol designed to handle transactions that span multiple resources, ensuring atomicity across all participants.
- **Phases:** Divided into two distinct phases â€” **Prepare Phase** and **Commit Phase**.

**Workflow:**

#### **Phase 1: Prepare Phase**
1. **Transaction Execution:** The coordinator sends a **prepare** request to all participating resources.
2. **Resource Response:** Each participant executes the transaction up to the point of commitment and then votes:
   - **Vote Commit:** If it can commit.
   - **Vote Abort:** If it cannot commit (e.g., due to a failure or conflict).

#### **Phase 2: Commit Phase**
1. **Coordinator Decision:**
   - **If All Vote Commit:** The coordinator sends a **commit** command to all participants.
   - **If Any Vote Abort:** The coordinator sends an **abort** command to all participants.
2. **Finalization:** Each participant commits or aborts the transaction based on the coordinator's command and acknowledges the action.

**Advantages:**
- **Atomicity Across Multiple Resources:** Ensures that either all resources commit or all abort, maintaining data consistency.
- **Reliability:** Widely adopted and proven in many distributed systems.

**Disadvantages:**
- **Blocking:** If the coordinator fails during the process, participants may be left waiting indefinitely, potentially causing a system-wide halt.
- **Performance Overhead:** Involves multiple network messages and acknowledgments, which can introduce latency.
- **Single Point of Failure:** The coordinator is a critical component; its failure can disrupt the entire commit process.

**Use Cases:**
- Distributed transactions involving multiple databases or services that require atomicity.

**Enhancements & Alternatives:**
- **Three-Phase Commit (3PC):** Introduces an additional phase to reduce the blocking problem but adds more complexity.
- **Paxos Commit:** Uses consensus algorithms to enhance reliability and fault tolerance.

### **Comparison Summary**

| Feature               | One-Phase Commit (1PC)                  | Two-Phase Commit (2PC)                      |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Number of Phases**  | Single phase                            | Two distinct phases (Prepare and Commit)     |
| **Use Case**          | Single-resource transactions            | Distributed transactions across multiple resources |
| **Complexity**        | Simple and straightforward              | More complex due to coordination between phases |
| **Atomicity**         | Limited to single resource              | Ensures atomicity across all participating resources |
| **Fault Tolerance**   | Lower, not suitable for multi-resource failures | Higher, but can still face blocking issues |

## 2. Types of Locks in Transaction Processing

Locking is a fundamental mechanism in database systems to ensure **concurrency control**, maintaining data consistency and isolation among concurrent transactions. Various types of locks manage how transactions interact with data resources.

### **Basic Lock Types**

1. **Shared Lock (S Lock):**
   - **Purpose:** Allows a transaction to read a data item.
   - **Concurrency:** Multiple transactions can hold shared locks on the same data item simultaneously.
   - **Constraints:** While a shared lock is held, no transaction can acquire an exclusive lock on that data item.

2. **Exclusive Lock (X Lock):**
   - **Purpose:** Allows a transaction to both read and write a data item.
   - **Concurrency:** Only one transaction can hold an exclusive lock on a data item at any given time.
   - **Constraints:** No other shared or exclusive locks can be held on the data item while an exclusive lock is active.

### **Intent Locks**

Intent locks are hierarchical locks that indicate a transactionâ€™s intention to acquire finer-grained locks (like shared or exclusive) on lower levels (like rows within a table).

1. **Intent Shared (IS):**
   - **Purpose:** Indicates a transaction intends to acquire shared locks on individual rows within a table.
   - **Hierarchy:** Placed on the table level.

2. **Intent Exclusive (IX):**
   - **Purpose:** Indicates a transaction intends to acquire exclusive locks on individual rows within a table.
   - **Hierarchy:** Placed on the table level.

3. **Shared Intent Exclusive (SIX):**
   - **Purpose:** Combines shared and intent exclusive locks, allowing a transaction to hold a shared lock on the table and intent exclusive locks on specific rows.
   - **Hierarchy:** Placed on the table level.

**Purpose of Intent Locks:**
- **Efficiency in Locking:** Helps the DBMS quickly determine if a lock request can be granted without checking every individual row.
- **Hierarchy Management:** Facilitates compatibility checks between different lock types at various hierarchical levels (e.g., table vs. row).

### **Other Lock Types**

1. **Update Lock (U Lock):**
   - **Purpose:** Prevents deadlocks during transactions that intend to upgrade from a shared lock to an exclusive lock.
   - **Usage:** Typically used during the read phase before a write operation.

2. **Schema Locks:**
   - **Purpose:** Protect the database schema during operations like altering tables.
   - **Types:**
     - **Schema Modification Lock (Sch-M):** For operations that modify the schema.
     - **Schema Stability Lock (Sch-S):** For operations that read the schema.

### **Lock Granularity**

Lock granularity refers to the size of the data item a lock applies to. Finer granularity allows more concurrency but may increase overhead.

1. **Row-Level Locks:**
   - **Description:** Locks individual rows in a table.
   - **Advantages:** Higher concurrency, as different transactions can lock different rows simultaneously.
   - **Disadvantages:** Increased overhead in managing numerous locks.

2. **Page-Level Locks:**
   - **Description:** Locks a page (a collection of rows) in the database.
   - **Advantages:** Balances concurrency and overhead.
   - **Disadvantages:** Potential for higher contention compared to row-level locks.

3. **Table-Level Locks:**
   - **Description:** Locks the entire table.
   - **Advantages:** Simplicity and lower overhead.
   - **Disadvantages:** Lower concurrency, as other transactions are blocked from accessing the table.

4. **Database-Level Locks:**
   - **Description:** Locks the entire database.
   - **Advantages:** Useful for operations that require complete isolation.
   - **Disadvantages:** Extremely low concurrency; generally used sparingly.

### **Locking Protocols**

Proper management of locks is crucial to avoid issues like deadlocks and ensure transaction isolation. Common locking protocols include:

1. **Two-Phase Locking (2PL):**
   - **Phases:**
     - **Growing Phase:** Transactions acquire locks but do not release any locks.
     - **Shrinking Phase:** Transactions release locks and do not acquire any new locks.
   - **Purpose:** Ensures serializability, preventing conflicts and maintaining consistency.
   - **Variants:**
     - **Strict 2PL:** Requires all exclusive locks to be held until the transaction commits or aborts, preventing cascading aborts.
     - **Rigorous 2PL:** Requires all locks (both shared and exclusive) to be held until the transaction commits or aborts.

2. **Timestamp Ordering:**
   - **Mechanism:** Assigns a unique timestamp to each transaction, ensuring that conflicting operations are executed in timestamp order.
   - **Purpose:** Guarantees serializability without using locks.

3. **Optimistic Concurrency Control:**
   - **Approach:** Transactions execute without acquiring locks but validate at commit time to ensure no conflicts occurred.
   - **Use Cases:** Suitable for environments with low contention.

### **Deadlocks and Their Prevention**

**Deadlock:** A situation where two or more transactions are waiting indefinitely for each other to release locks.

**Prevention Strategies:**
1. **Deadlock Detection and Recovery:**
   - **Detection:** Regularly check for cycles in the wait-for graph.
   - **Recovery:** Abort one or more transactions involved in the deadlock to break the cycle.

2. **Deadlock Prevention:**
   - **Ordering Resources:** Enforce a strict order in which transactions acquire locks.
   - **Timeouts:** Abort transactions if they wait too long for a lock.

3. **Using Timeout Mechanisms:**
   - **Description:** Transactions are aborted if they cannot acquire necessary locks within a specified timeframe.

### **Example Scenario**

**Scenario:** Two transactions, T1 and T2, attempting to access the same data.

- **T1:**
  1. Acquires a **shared lock** on Row A to read data.
  2. Later requests an **exclusive lock** on Row B to update data.

- **T2:**
  1. Acquires a **shared lock** on Row B to read data.
  2. Later requests an **exclusive lock** on Row A to update data.

**Potential Deadlock:**
- T1 holds a shared lock on Row A and waits for an exclusive lock on Row B.
- T2 holds a shared lock on Row B and waits for an exclusive lock on Row A.
- Both transactions are waiting for each other to release locks, leading to a deadlock.

**Resolution:**
- The DBMS detects the deadlock and aborts one of the transactions (e.g., T2) to allow T1 to proceed.
- T2 can be retried later.

---

## **Conclusion**

Understanding commit protocols and locking mechanisms is fundamental to designing robust and efficient database systems. 

- **One-Phase Commit (1PC)** is suitable for simple, single-resource transactions but lacks the atomicity needed for distributed systems.
- **Two-Phase Commit (2PC)** provides a reliable way to ensure atomicity across multiple resources, albeit with added complexity and potential performance overhead.

On the other hand, **locking mechanisms** play a crucial role in maintaining data consistency and transaction isolation. Different types of locks and locking protocols, such as **Two-Phase Locking (2PL)**, help manage concurrent access, prevent conflicts, and ensure that transactions do not interfere with each other in detrimental ways.

Mastering these concepts is essential for database administrators, developers, and anyone involved in the design and maintenance of transactional systems.

Ah, you're referring to **selecting columns from two tables using a comma-separated list (Cartesian product)** versus using a **JOIN**. Let’s compare the two approaches:

---

### **1. Selecting with `FROM a, b` (Cartesian Product)**

#### Query Example:
```sql
SELECT a.x, b.y
FROM a, b;
```

#### What Happens:
- This performs a **Cartesian product** (cross join) of the two tables, meaning every row in table `a` is combined with every row in table `b`.  
- The result set will have `rows_in_a × rows_in_b` rows.

#### Use Cases:
- Rarely used unless the goal is specifically to calculate combinations (e.g., pairing all rows of two tables).
- Useful for generating datasets for testing or scenarios where no relationship exists between the tables.

#### Drawbacks:
- If tables are large, the result set can grow exponentially, causing performance issues.
- Generally inefficient and not meaningful unless further filtering (via a `WHERE` clause) is applied.

## Example with Filtering:
```sql
SELECT a.x, b.y
FROM a, b
WHERE a.id = b.a_id; <--------------------------------------------------------------------
```
- This mimics a `JOIN` but uses explicit filtering in the `WHERE` clause instead of join syntax.

---

### **2. Using a `JOIN`**

#### Query Example:
```sql
SELECT a.x, b.y
FROM a
JOIN b ON a.id = b.a_id;
```

#### What Happens:
- This performs an **inner join**, which means only rows where `a.id = b.a_id` will be included in the result.
- Filters rows at the database level, reducing the result size compared to a Cartesian product.

#### Use Cases:
- When tables are related via a specific condition (e.g., foreign key relationships).
- Efficiently retrieving combined data without generating irrelevant combinations.

#### Advantages:
- Better readability and clarity.
- Database optimizers handle joins more efficiently than Cartesian products with filtering.

### **Comparison: Cartesian Product vs JOIN**

| **Feature**                  | **`FROM a, b` (Cartesian Product)**         | **`JOIN`**                              |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Mechanism**                | Combines all rows from both tables         | Combines rows based on a relationship    |
| **Size of Result Set**       | Exponential (`rows_in_a × rows_in_b`)      | Filtered result based on `ON` condition |
| **Performance**              | Inefficient for large tables              | Optimized by the database engine         |
| **Readability**              | Harder to understand without filtering    | Clear and explicit                      |
| **Use Case**                 | Testing or unrelated datasets             | Related datasets with a defined link    |

### **Example with Tables**

#### Tables:
- Table `a`:
  | id | x  |
  |----|----|
  | 1  | 10 |
  | 2  | 20 |

- Table `b`:
  | a_id | y  |
  |------|----|
  | 1    | 100 |
  | 2    | 200 |

---

#### Query 1: Cartesian Product (`FROM a, b`)
```sql
SELECT a.x, b.y
FROM a, b;
```

#### Result:
| x  | y   |
|----|-----|
| 10 | 100 |
| 10 | 200 |
| 20 | 100 |
| 20 | 200 |

---

#### Query 2: JOIN
```sql
SELECT a.x, b.y
FROM a
JOIN b ON a.id = b.a_id;
```

#### Result:
| x  | y   |
|----|-----|
| 10 | 100 |
| 20 | 200 |

---

### **Key Insights**:
1. **Use Cartesian product (`FROM a, b`) sparingly**, as it generates all possible combinations unless filtered with `WHERE`.
2. **Prefer `JOIN`** for related tables, as it is optimized for combining rows with a clear relationship.
3. If you write `FROM a, b WHERE a.id = b.a_id`, it behaves like a `JOIN` but is less explicit and harder to read.
